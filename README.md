Built a classifier that detects whether a political statement from US 2016 elections is fake news or not.

• ```Solution```: Performed an experimental approach based on “Liar, Liar Pants on Fire”: A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection. Incorporated various feature engineering procedure including web-scraping to generate attributes to help classify fake news. Implemented text mining and deep learning modeling techniques to distinguish between various labels of statements. Transformed and modeled the problem in 4 different approaches to seek the best result in each case. Assessed models performance based on minimum classification error rate.

• ```Result```: In this experiment, achieved 70.38% accuracy on Binary classification, 57.99% accuracy on three-class multinomial classification, 42.4% accuracy on six-class multinomial and ordinal classification.

Note: The given dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed.
